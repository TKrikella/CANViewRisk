 Welcome to CANViewRisk, a Shiny application developed by Canadian statisticians 
                      to help visualize risk using best-practice methods. We allow users to develop 
                      icon arrays (ie. pictographs) to visualize absolute risks in the form of frequencies. Icon arrays 
                      have been shown to be an effective visualization for those with lower numeracy; 
                      conveying risks in terms of absolute risk instead of relative risk reduces 
                      misinterpretation and prevents exaggerated perceptions of benefit or harm. 
                    
This application is organized into four tabs. The first is this introduction 
                      tab, which includes helpful definitions and examples. The 'Single Absolute Risk' 
                      tab allows you to input a single value to generate a visualization. The 
                      'Single Relative Risk' tab calculates the change between a baseline risk and 
                      a second outcome based on a relative increase, displaying them as two icon arrays. 
                      Finally, the 'Compare Two Absolute Risks' tab allows for a side-by-side comparison 
                      of two independent risks. In all three visualization tabs, you can export 
                      your icon arrays as a PDF.
                      
To run the application, please ensure you download not only the Rcode, but also the .png files found in the www folder. 
These images are used to create the icon arrays in the app.
